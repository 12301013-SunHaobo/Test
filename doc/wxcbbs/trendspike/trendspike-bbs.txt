in the last two years, the max drawdown is less than 1% excluding the error from my code in Jan this year. I usually have one or two losing days in one months, and the loss is usually recovered in the next two days. 
the loss is due to complacency of straight win since sept.1. will be more cautious in the future. always make the same mistake, that is, more aggressive after no-losing days for many weeks then followed by a severe hit.来源: trendspike 于 08-11-20 09:33:21 
机器交易软件今年共让我损失40000刀。一月份由此小数点算错，由于我编程时忘了整数，浮动小数文件读取得差百(difference between atoi and atof), 那次无端输25000.今天是因为昨天毕盘时,机器突然帮我买进40万的股票,当时报侥幸,没有对冲.今天开盘就输6000多.现在也没查出是什么原因机器突然买进那么多股票的.看来机器交易问题多多呀.来源: trendspike 于 08-11-11 11:22:39 
since this month made the record for my two-years trading experience, I thus briefly post the trading result here. In October, the system opened over 4000 positions in total which resulted roughly 30% profit with no losing days. The system was started two years ago, so far no losing month, even almost no losing weeks (except very few i still remember).trendspike 于 08-10-31 11:10:43 
我的研究表明，所以书上写着的指标，最高盈利不超过千分之一，二。其中最好的指标是MACD.但它也不超过千分之二。来源: trendspike 于 08-12-12 08:13:23

 交易方法无所谓对错。错的是输钱。我也不用书上那些统计。我有自己的指标。 来源: trendspike 于 08-12-12 08:20:31

There is a simple process....
Open for example EUR/USD in two time frames

a) 15 minute
b) 5 minute
Add MACD indicator in both charts

If You see that the 15 minute chart is heading down.
wait for the crossover in the 5 minute chart of the MACD
Once it has crossed over...enter with a sell order by market
and give it a limit of 10 pips and a stop loss of 20 pips

Similarly if the market moves up
wait for a crossover in the 5 minute chart

This is a very patient game and only enter at the crossover.

8 out of 10 times you will be successfull...

Try it out...and let me know if you are successfull.

A range is characterized by a failure of higher highs and lower lows, and looking for price swings almost like a sin wave.

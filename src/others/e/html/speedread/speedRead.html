<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. Keith: Compliance with new government regulations
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requiring the installation of smoke alarms and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprinkler systems in all theaters and arenas will cost
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the entertainment industry $25 billion annually.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, jobs will be lost and profits diminished.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, these regulations will harm the country’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economy.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura: The $25 billion spent by some businesses will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be revenue for others. Jobs and profits will be gained
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as lost.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura responds to Keith by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) demonstrating that Keith’s conclusion is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on evidence that is not relevant to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue at hand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) challenging the plausibility of the evidence that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serves as the basis for Keith’s argument
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) suggesting that Keith’s argument overlooks a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mitigating consequence
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) reinforcing Keith’s conclusion by supplying a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complementary interpretation of the evidence
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith cites
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) agreeing with the main conclusion of Keith’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument but construing that conclusion as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grounds for optimism rather than for pessimism
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. In the United States, of the people who moved from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one state to another when they retired, the percentage
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who retired to Florida has decreased by three
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percentage points over the past ten years. Since
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many local businesses in Florida cater to retirees,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these declines are likely to have a noticeably negative
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic effect on these businesses and therefore
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the economy of Florida.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the argument given?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) People who moved from one state to another
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they retired moved a greater distance,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on average, last year than such people did ten
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) People were more likely to retire to North
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolina from another state last year than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people were ten years ago.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The number of people who moved from one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state to another when they retired has increased
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signifi cantly over the past ten years.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The number of people who left Florida when they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retired to live in another state was greater last
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year than it was ten years ago.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Florida attracts more people who move from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one state to another when they retire than does
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other state.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Businesses are suffering because of a lack of money
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available for development loans. To help businesses,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the government plans to modify the income-tax
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure in order to induce individual taxpayers to put
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a larger portion of their incomes into retirement
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;savings accounts, because as more money is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deposited in such accounts, more money becomes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available to borrowers.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, raises the most serious
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt regarding the effectiveness of the government’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plan to increase the amount of money available for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development loans for businesses?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) When levels of personal retirement savings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase, consumer borrowing always increases
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correspondingly.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The increased tax revenue the government
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would receive as a result of business expansion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not offset the loss in revenue from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal income taxes during the first year of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the plan.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Even with tax incentives, some people will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose not to increase their levels of retirement
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;savings.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Bankers generally will not continue to lend
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money to businesses whose prospective
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earnings are insufficient to meet their loan
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repayment schedules.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) The modified tax structure would give all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taxpayers, regardless of their incomes, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same tax savings for a given increase in their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retirement savings.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Since it has become known that several of a bank’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top executives have been buying shares in their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own bank, the bank’s depositors, who had been
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worried by rumors that the bank faced impending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi nancial collapse, have been greatly relieved. They
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason that, since top executives evidently have faith
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the bank’s fi nancial soundness, those worrisome
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rumors must be false. Such reasoning might well be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overoptimistic, however, since corporate executives
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been known to buy shares in their own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company in a calculated attempt to dispel
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative rumors about the company’s health.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which of the following roles?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The fi rst describes evidence that has been taken
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as supporting a conclusion; the second gives a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason for questioning that support.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The fi rst describes evidence that has been taken
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as supporting a conclusion; the second states a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contrary conclusion that is the main conclusion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the argument.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The fi rst provides evidence in support of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main conclusion of the argument; the second
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states that conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The fi rst describes the circumstance that the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument as a whole seeks to explain; the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second gives the explanation that the argument
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeks to establish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) The fi rst describes the circumstance that the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument as a whole seeks to explain; the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second provides evidence in support of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explanation that the argument seeks to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. A new law gives ownership of patents—documents
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providing exclusive right to make and sell an
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invention—to universities, not the government, when
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those patents result from government-sponsored
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;university research. Administrators at Logos University
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plan to sell any patents they acquire to corporations in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order to fund programs to improve undergraduate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teaching.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, would cast the most
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt on the viability of the college administrators’
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plan described above?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Profit-making corporations interested in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing products based on patents held by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universities are likely to try to serve as exclusive
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sponsors of ongoing university research
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projects.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Corporate sponsors of research in university
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilities are entitled to tax credits under new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;federal tax-code guidelines.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Research scientists at Logos University have few
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or no teaching responsibilities and participate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little if at all in the undergraduate programs in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their field.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Government-sponsored research conducted at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logos University for the most part duplicates
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research already completed by several profitmaking
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporations.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Logos University is unlikely to attract corporate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sponsorship of its scientific research.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Environmentalist: The commissioner of the Fish and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game Authority would have the public believe that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increases in the number of marine fish caught
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrate that this resource is no longer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endangered. This is a specious argument, as unsound
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it would be to assert that the ever-increasing rate at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which rain forests are being cut down demonstrates a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lack of danger to that resource. The real cause of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased fish-catch is a greater efficiency in using
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies that deplete resources.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmentalist’s statements, if true, best
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support which of the following as a conclusion?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The use of technology is the reason for the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increasing encroachment of people on nature.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) It is possible to determine how many fish are in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea in some way other than by catching fish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The proportion of marine fish that are caught is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as high as the proportion of rain forest trees
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are cut down each year.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Modern technologies waste resources by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;catching inedible fish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Marine fish continue to be an endangered
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offi cial Guide for GMAT? Review 12th Edition
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;514
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. In the country of Veltria, the past two years’ broad
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic recession has included a business downturn
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the clothing trade, where sales are down by about
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 percent as compared to two years ago. Clothing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wholesalers have found, however, that the proportion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of credit extended to retailers that was paid off on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time fell sharply in the fi rst year of the recession but
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned to its prerecession level in the second year.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the change between the fi rst and the second year of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the recession in the proportion of credit not paid off
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on time?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The total amount of credit extended to retailers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by clothing wholesalers increased between the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi rst year of the recession and the second year.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Between the fi rst and second years of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recession, clothing retailers in Veltria saw many
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their costs, rent and utilities in particular,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Of the considerable number of clothing retailers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Veltria who were having fi nancial diffi culties
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the start of the recession, virtually all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were forced to go out of business during its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first year.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Clothing retailers in Veltria attempted to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stimulate sales in the second year of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recession by discounting merchandise.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Relatively recession-proof segments of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothing trade, such as work clothes, did not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffer any decrease in sales during the fi rst year
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the recession.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Commentator: The theory of trade retaliation states
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that countries closed out of any of another country’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;markets should close some of their own markets to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other country in order to pressure the other
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country to reopen its markets. If every country acted
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to this theory, no country would trade with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commentator’s argument relies on which of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following assumptions?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) No country actually acts according to the theory
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of trade retaliation.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) No country should block any of its markets to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreign trade.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Trade disputes should be settled by international
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribunal.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) For any two countries, at least one has some
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market closed to the other.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Countries close their markets to foreigners to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protect domestic producers.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. Studies in restaurants show that the tips left by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customers who pay their bill in cash tend to be larger
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a creditcard
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logo. Consumer psychologists hypothesize that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply seeing a credit-card logo makes many creditcard
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holders willing to spend more because it reminds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them that their spending power exceeds the cash they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have immediately available.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the psychologists’ interpretation of the studies?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The effect noted in the studies is not limited to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patrons who have credit cards.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Patrons who are under fi nancial pressure from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their credit-card obligations tend to tip less when
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presented with a restaurant bill on a tray with a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credit-card logo than when the tray has no logo.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) In virtually all of the cases in the studies, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patrons who paid bills in cash did not possess
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credit cards.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) In general, restaurant patrons who pay their bills
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in cash leave larger tips than do those who pay
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by credit card.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) The percentage of restaurant bills paid with a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given brand of credit card increases when that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credit card’s logo is displayed on the tray with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the bill is presented.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Although parapsychology is often considered a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pseudoscience, it is in fact a genuine scientific
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enterprise, for it uses scientific methods such as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled experiments and statistical tests of clearly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stated hypotheses to examine the questions it raises.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion above is properly drawn if which of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following is assumed?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) If a field of study can conclusively answer the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions it raises, then it is a genuine science.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Since parapsychology uses scientific methods, it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will produce credible results.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Any enterprise that does not use controlled
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiments and statistical tests is not genuine
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Any field of study that employs scientific
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods is a genuine scientific enterprise.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Since parapsychology raises clearly statable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions, they can be tested in controlled
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiments.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Hotco oil burners, designed to be used in asphalt
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plants, are so efficient that Hotco will sell one to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clifton Asphalt plant for no payment other than the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost savings between the total amount the asphalt
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plant actually paid for oil using its former burner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the last two years and the total amount it will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay for oil using the Hotco burner during the next two
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. On installation, the plant will make an estimated
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payment, which will be adjusted after two years to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal the actual cost savings.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if it occurred, would constitute
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a disadvantage for Hotco of the plan described above?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Another manufacturer’s introduction to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market of a similarly efficient burner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The Clifton Asphalt plant’s need for more than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one new burner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Very poor efficiency in the Clifton Asphalt plant’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old burner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) A decrease in the demand for asphalt
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) A steady increase in the price of oil beginning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon after the new burner is installed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. Delta Products Inc. has recently switched at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least partly from older technologies using fossil
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fuels to new technologies powered by electricity.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been raised whether it can be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concluded that for a given level of output Delta’s
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation now causes less fossil fuel to be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumed than it did formerly. The answer,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly, is yes, since the amount of fossil fuel used to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generate the electricity needed to power the new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies is less than the amount needed to power
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the older technologies, provided level of output is held
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constant.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which of the following roles?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The fi rst identifi es the content of the conclusion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the argument; the second provides support
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for that conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The fi rst provides support for the conclusion of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the argument; the second identifi es the content
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The fi rst states the conclusion of the argument;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second calls that conclusion into question.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The fi rst provides support for the conclusion of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the argument; the second calls that conclusion
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into question.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Each provides support for the conclusion of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. An experiment was done in which human subjects
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognize a pattern within a matrix of abstract designs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then select another design that completes that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pattern. The results of the experiment were surprising.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest expenditure of energy in neurons in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain was found in those subjects who performed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most successfully in the experiments.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following hypotheses best accounts for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the findings of the experiment?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The neurons of the brain react less when a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject is trying to recognize patterns than when
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the subject is doing other kinds of reasoning.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Those who performed best in the experiment
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced more satisfaction when working
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with abstract patterns than did those who
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performed less well.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) People who are better at abstract pattern
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognition have more energy-efficient neural
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connections.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The energy expenditure of the subjects’ brains
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increases when a design that completes the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initially recognized pattern is determined.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) The task of completing a given design is more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capably performed by athletes, whose energy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expenditure is lower when they are at rest.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. Which of the following most logically completes the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irradiation of food kills bacteria and thus retards
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoilage. However, it also lowers the nutritional value
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of many foods. For example, irradiation destroys a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signifi cant percentage of whatever vitamin B1 a food
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may contain. Proponents of irradiation point out that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irradiation is no worse in this respect than cooking.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this fact is either beside the point, since
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much irradiated food is eaten raw, or else misleading,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) many of the proponents of irradiation are food
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distributors who gain from foods’ having a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer shelf life
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) it is clear that killing bacteria that may be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present on food is not the only effect that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irradiation has
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) cooking is usually the fi nal step in preparing food
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for consumption, whereas irradiation serves to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure a longer shelf life for perishable foods
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) certain kinds of cooking are, in fact, even more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destructive of vitamin B1 than carefully
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled irradiation is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) for food that is both irradiated and cooked, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduction of vitamin B1 associated with either
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process individually is compounded
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. One way to judge the performance of a company is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to compare it with other companies. This technique,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonly called “benchmarking,” permits the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manager of a company to discover better industrial
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practices and can provide a justification for the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption of good practices.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of the following, if true, is a valid reason for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benchmarking the performance of a company against
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies with which it is not in competition rather
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than against competitors EXCEPT:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Comparisons with competitors are most likely to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on practices that the manager making the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comparisons already employs.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Getting “inside” information about the unique
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practices of competitors is particularly difficult.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Since companies that compete with each other
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are likely to have comparable levels of efficiency,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only benchmarking against noncompetitors is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to reveal practices that would aid in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beating competitors.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Managers are generally more receptive to new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas that they find outside their own industry.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Much of the success of good companies is due
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their adoption of practices that take
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage of the special circumstances of their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products or markets.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. For a trade embargo against a particular country to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;succeed, a high degree of both international accord
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ability to prevent goods from entering or leaving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that country must be sustained. A total blockade of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patria’s ports is necessary to an embargo, but such an
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action would be likely to cause international discord
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the embargo.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claims above, if true, most strongly support which
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the following conclusions?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The balance of opinion is likely to favor Patria in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the event of a blockade.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) As long as international opinion is unanimously
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Patria, a trade embargo is likely to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;succeed.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) A naval blockade of Patria’s ports would ensure
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that no goods enter or leave Patria.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Any trade embargo against Patria would be likely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fail at some time.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) For a blockade of Patria’s ports to be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successful, international opinion must be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unanimous.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Theater Critic: The play La Finestrina, now at Central
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theater, was written in Italy in the eighteenth century.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director claims that this production is as similar to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original production as is possible in a modern
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theater. Although the actor who plays Harlequin the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clown gives a performance very reminiscent of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twentieth-century American comedian Groucho Marx,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx’s comic style was very much within the comic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acting tradition that had begun in sixteenth-century
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The considerations given best serve as part of an
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) modern audiences would fi nd it hard to tolerate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain characteristics of a historically accurate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance of an eighteenth-century play
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Groucho Marx once performed the part of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character Harlequin in La Finestrina
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) in the United States the training of actors in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twentieth century is based on principles that do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not differ radically from those that underlay the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training of actors in eighteenth-century Italy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) the performance of the actor who plays
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harlequin in La Finestrina does not serve as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence against the director’s claim
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) the director of La Finestrina must have advised
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the actor who plays Harlequin to model his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance on comic performances of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groucho Marx
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. The cost of producing radios in Country Q is 10
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percent less than the cost of producing radios in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Country Y. Even after transportation fees and tariff
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charges are added, it is still cheaper for a company to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import radios from Country Q to Country Y than to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce radios in Country Y.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements above, if true, best support which of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following assertions?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Labor costs in Country Q are 10 percent below
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those in Country Y.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Importing radios from Country Q to Country Y
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will eliminate 10 percent of the manufacturing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs in Country Y.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The tariff on a radio imported from Country Q to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Country Y is less than 10 percent of the cost of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manufacturing the radio in Country Y.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The fee for transporting a radio from Country Q
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Country Y is more than 10 percent of the cost
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of manufacturing the radio in Country Q.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) It takes 10 percent less time to manufacture a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radio in Country Q than it does in Country Y.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Although the discount stores in Goreville’s central
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shopping district are expected to close within fi ve
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years as a result of competition from a SpendLess
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discount department store that just opened, those
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locations will not stay vacant for long. In the fi ve years
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since the opening of Colson’s, a nondiscount
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;department store, a new store has opened at the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location of every store in the shopping district that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closed because it could not compete with Colson’s.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the argument?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Many customers of Colson’s are expected to do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less shopping there than they did before the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SpendLess store opened.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Increasingly, the stores that have opened in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;central shopping district since Colson’s opened
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been discount stores.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) At present, the central shopping district has as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many stores operating in it as it ever had.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Over the course of the next fi ve years, it is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected that Goreville’s population will grow at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a faster rate than it has for the past several
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decades.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Many stores in the central shopping district sell
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;types of merchandise that are not available at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either SpendLess or Colson’s.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The average normal infant born in the United States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weighs between 12 and 14 pounds at the age of three
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months. Therefore, if a three-month-old child weighs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only 10 pounds, its weight gain has been below the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United States average.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following indicates a flaw in the reasoning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Weight is only one measure of normal infant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Some three-month-old children weigh as much
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as 17 pounds.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) It is possible for a normal child to weigh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 pounds at birth.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The phrase “below average” does not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessarily mean insufficient.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Average weight gain is not the same as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average weight.
